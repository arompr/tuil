# üåô tuil

A Terminal UI for Brightness & Night Light Control to manually adjust screen brightness and night light right from terminal.

I run a very lightweight Hyprland setup, and while it's incredibly efficient, I found myself missing a quick and **user-friendly** way to tweak brightness and night light without leaving terminal.

tuil fills that gap. While it uses hyprsunset for a tailored Hyprland nightlight control experience, it was designed to be easily adaptable - just implement a new adapter and pass it to the nightlight use cases instead of the hyprsunset adapter.

I also made a simple ctl that starts Hyprsunset with the last saved value.
If you want to use it at startup as I do, build it then add to your Hyprland config file:

```console
exec-once tuilctl --temperature
```

## Requirements

- **Hyprland** >= 0.48  
- **hyprsunset** >= 0.2  
- **brightnessctl** (used for screen brightness control)

## Build instructions

Build tuil executable

```console
go build -o tuil
```

Build tuilctl executable

```console
go build -o tuilctl ./ctl
```

Add to path. For example:

```console
sudo mv tuil /usr/local/bin/
```

## üõ†Ô∏è TODO

- [ ] Cleanup `tui.go` for better structure and readability
- [ ] Improve error logging
- [ ] Apply rollback on process kill or close without save
- [ ] Improve min/max value handling
- [ ] Add to the AUR - I use Arch, btw
