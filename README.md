# ðŸŒ™ tuil - A Work in progress -
A Terminal UI for Brightness & Night Light Control to manually adjust screen brightness and night light right from your terminal.

I run a lightweight Hyprland setup, and while it's incredibly efficient, I found myself missing a user-friendly and quick way to tweak brightness and night light manually without leaving terminal.

tuil fills that gap. It's tailored for Hyprland as it uses hyprsunset for nightlight control.
